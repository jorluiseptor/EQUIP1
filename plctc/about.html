					<em>Professional Learning Communities in the Teachers' College </em>was 
					developed under the guidance of John Hatch the USAID AOTR of 
					EQUIP1, and Judy Benjamin Project Director of EQUIP1 at the American 
					Institutes for Research (AIR) in Washington, D.C.  Under new leadership, 
					continued support was provided by Suezan Lee, USAID AOTR of 
					EQUIP1 and Jeff Davis, AIR Director of EQUIP1. Cassandra Jessee, 
					Deputy Director for EQUIP1, sought valuable feedback and suggestions 
					from teacher educators in Africa to help to make the book relevant to 
					teacher educators in different contexts. Feedback, excellent criticism 
					and suggestions on improving the material have been provided by 
					James O'Rourke, Lars Dahlstrom, Ellen Carm, Kjersti Augland, and Lorie 
					Brush.  Dr. Janet Robb's unwavering commitment to the <em>Professional 
					Learning Communities in the Teachers' College</em> from start to finish was 
					highly valued by all of us on the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inspiration for development of this resource and many excellent ideas 
					for inclusion in the material came from many colleagues in education 
					throughout Africa.  In particular, we would like to thank Joy's Zambian 
					colleagues who provided many of the ideas for this resource and helped 
					to ground them in the African context.  Special thanks to Simon Chiputa, 
					Malinda Malinda, James Silwimba, Esvah Chizambe, Edward Tindi, 
					Father Fred Kabwe, Audrey Mwansa, Peter Sampa and Evans Mumba. 
					Additional thanks goes to those who participated in focus groups in 
					Malawi and Zambia and helped ensure this resource met your needs: 
					Stephen Malambo, Jonathan Haazela, Mathias Chuunga, Harrson 
					Moono, Geoffrey Chilika from Luwangwa Teacher Training College, 
					Zambia; Mary Chutu Chilele, and Lazarous Mutale, Center for Curriculum 
					Development, Zambian Ministry of Education; Ruth Gonano, Wexton 
					Chalera, Edith Waluz, Davison Butawo, Douglas JB Gondwe, and 
					Gentry Chipeta, of Kasungu Teacher Training College; and Eve Lemani, 
					Yoas Kamingira, and Davies Kaambankadzanja of Malawi Institute of 
					Education.

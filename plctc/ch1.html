					<em>&quot;Teacher educators at all 
					levels, whether school 
					or college-based, need 
					to have induction and 
					continuing professional 
					development. This 
					should ensure that they 
					are aware of recent 
					developments, can judge 
					whether these should be 
					incorporated into training, 
					have perspectives that

				</p>
				<p class="fp">
					In the absence of professional learning communities, teachers learn a lot on their own, 
					effectively teaching themselves how to teach (Huberman, 1995). Huberman terms this 
					isolated self-teaching the 'lone wolf' paradigm of professional development and argues 
					that many teachers tinker, problem-solve, experiment, reason and take action in their 
					classrooms as they grow professionally throughout their careers. However, learning in 
					isolation does not bring us in touch with new ideas. While it may help teacher educators 
					to achieve expertise in existing practices, it does not usually help them improve practice 
					through reflecting upon and challenging their existing ideas. Changing teacher beliefs and 
					practices to go to new levels of expertise requires more interaction with a community of like 
					minded people (Huberman, 1995, p. 206).  Without engagement with others to discuss their 
					teaching and ideas about experimenting in the classroom, teacher educators and teachers 
					are more likely to "to remain 'stuck' at lower levels of mastery for lack of explicit counsel 
					from external experts or experienced peers" (Huberman, 1995, p. 206).
				</p><figure class="float-l"><img src="../_img/slides/ch1/IMG_1034.jpg" class="imgfix"></figure>
				<p>
					What would happen if you were to replace the 'lone wolf' paradigm by connecting teacher 
					educators with each other through forming professional learning communities? Research 
					has indicated that when teachers [and by extension teacher educators] engage in 
					professional development activities aimed at meeting shared goals of improving practice in 
					collaboration with other colleagues and experts, teachers are more likely to develop higher 
					levels of expertise (DuFour, 2004). The main activities of teachers in these communities 
					are: experience sharing, pedagogical analysis, observation, demonstration, feedback, 
					experimentation, developing new methods, and technical consultations from advisors. 
					These professional learning communities can be among teachers within a school, teachers 
					from different schools, and networks of teachers with outside counsel from teacher centers 
					or other advisors.

					&quot;Changing teacher beliefs &amp; practices&quot;
				</p>
				<p>
					Collegiality and networking improves practice. More successful 
					and effective schools (as defined by learner performance 
					and school atmosphere) are found to have greater workplace 
					collegiality and experimentation by teachers (Little, 1982). Little 
					(1982) also found that the norms of collegiality (faculty working 
					together) that were most powerful in professional growth included 
					planning for, designing, conducting, analyzing, evaluating and 
					experimenting with the business of teaching. When teachers 
					understand that other colleagues have something new to 
					offer them and that they stand to grow professionally through 
					collaborative interactions, they are more likely to engage in 
					professional development. Professional engagement with 
					colleagues must also include critical practices (e.g., analysis 
					and evaluation) for it to be meaningful to teachers.
				</p><figure class="float-r"><img src="../_img/slides/ch1/IMG_0051.jpg" class="imgfix"></figure>
				<p>
					Being part of a professional learning community is preferable 
					to working as a 'lone wolf,' but professions are more than just 
					networks. They are organized as <em>communities of practice</em> consisting of both novice beginners and experts. The novices 
					begin at the margins of the community and, through interactions 
					with more experienced participants, continually become more 
					involved and experienced members. Such a community—with 
					shared interests, crafts, or professions—are called <em>communities 
					of practice</em> (Lave, 1991; Lave &amp; Wenger, 2002). Etienne Wenger 
					developed the notion of <em>communities of practice</em> as a way to 
					explain the theory and practice of learning as a social endeavor. 
					He believed that learning is fundamentally a result of social 
					participation and that learning is &quot;both a kind of action and 
					a form of belonging.&quot; (Wenger, 1999, p. 4). According to this 
					perspective, learning does not just happen within classrooms 
					and training sessions or just from textbooks, homework and 
					exercises. Learning through participation in a community is 
					consistent with the views of <span class="hasfootnote" title="See Chapter 5 for a discussion on Indigenous Knowledge Systems">African indigenous learning</span> which 
					holds that learning is holistic, takes place in the community 
					and is ongoing in everyday life. Learning is integral to life, and 
					professional lives require creating and sustaining <em>communities 
					of practice</em> in which teacher educators can live and learn as 
					professionals. Such communities, then, become valuable tools 
					for learning, growth and development. In this chapter, we use 
					the term <em>communities of practice</em> and professional learning 
					communities interchangeably.
				</p>
				<p>
					Professional learning communities, or <em>communities of practice</em>, 
					exist in all walks of life. Most people belong to more than one 
					such community at any given time. For example, you may 
					simultaneously be a member of a sports team, your family, 
					your class, a chorus or musical group, workers (including 
					teachers), a church or mosque and even e-communities of 
					individuals with a common interest who communicate on the 
					World Wide Web. All of these are <em>communities of practice</em>. As 
					individuals participate in <em>communities of practice</em> they share a 
					set of practices including norms of interaction, repertoires of 
					activities, and discourses (ways of talking) that they eventually 
					begin to own. According to this perspective, acquiring these 
					norms of interaction is the same as learning to be a professional.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cognition—the process of acquiring ideas and concepts—is 
					seen as an individual activity under the 'lone wolf' paradigm. 
					However, under the <em>communities of practice</em> perspective, 
					cognition is seen as being situated in a particular context. 
					That is to say, your cognition is inseparable from your activities 
					as a professional. This is referred to as <span class="hasfootnote" title="This topic is taken up in more detail in Chapter 3"><em>situated cognition</em></span> of <em>communities of practice</em> (Putnam &amp; Borko, 2000). In contrast to 
					what was generally called &quot;staff development&quot; where teacher 
					development was often individualized, off-site, not connected 
					to the context of school or one's own teaching experience, 
					and didn't result in increased mastery of content, Putnam and 
					Borko (2000) called for an approach to teacher development 
					that is both social and contextual. Thus, under this perspective, 
					teacher learning and development takes place among<em> communities of practice</em> as teachers share a common discourse and participate in 
					authentic learning activities. Authentic learning activities are real experiences in the 
					context of the teachers' work and lives.
				</p>
				<aside>
					<p>
						<strong>Teacher educators </strong>can transform their practice through
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>updating their knowledge on salient educational issues for teacher education</li>
						<li>engaging in critical dialogue about those issues in relation to their personal beliefs and the local context</li>
						<li>developing a reflective approach to their practice </li>
					</ul>
				</aside>
				
				<p>
					The notion of <em>communities of practice</em> is already practiced in many parts of Africa. 
					School-based teacher groups or conferences that allow teachers to engage with their 
					peers in local problem solving, share experiences and ideas, interpret the curriculum 
					and reforms, and assist new teachers, are all examples of such communities in action. 
					In such activities, advisors or senior teachers provide expert assistance [or outside 
					counsel] to groups when needed. These outside experts are usually classroom 
					teachers who have been promoted to provide assistance to others because of success 
					in the classroom and assisting other teachers. In addition to school based professional 
					learning communities, teachers often meet with teachers from other schools in a school 
					cluster and other increasingly larger administrative units (circuit, district, county, etc.). 
					Participation at most levels in most places, and especially at the school level, is often 
					included in the conditions of service or terms of work of teachers, and there are rarely 
					external incentives (monetary or otherwise) for participation. Teachers are therefore 
					compelled to particpate by an inherent collegiality and participation is quite common.
				</p>
				<p>
					Professional learning communities are less common among teacher educators at 
					colleges, however. Overloaded tutors' schedules, large numbers of student teachers, 
					lack of a supportive environment for professional development, lack of resources, and 
					traditions of professional engagement are some of the impediments on development 
					of professional <em>communities of practice</em> among teacher educators. These factors tend 
					to skew teacher educators' participation away from professional learning communities. 
					Sometimes association of monetary allowances for participation in professional 
					development can also work against the development of professional <em>communities of 
					practice</em>. These barriers are real, but so is the responsibility to develop oneself as a 
					professional.
				<p>
					Setting up professional learning communities in your college can be stimulating and 
					professionally rewarding. Participation in professional learning communities may 
					also trigger self-doubts about one's mastery of teaching, learning, and instructional 
					management. That is why it is important that all those who participate develop and 
					adhere to norms of practice that provide a secure environment to examine beliefs 
					and experiment with them in the classroom. It is important that professional learning 
					communities go beyond a discussion culture and include experimentation with 
					classroom practice. This experimentation should include observations by others, 
					feedback, evaluation and further practice.
				<p>
					What would creating professional communities at teachers colleges involve? At a 
					minimum, this would involve creating structures within the college (groups, times, 
					meeting places, space on the timetable, etc.) and the identification of resources 
					both within and outside the college. It also requires work and commitment to get 
					it started. The interpersonal bonds that build up over time among members of the
					group will help staff to move from friendly conversation to deeper dialogue 
					on important professional issues. Change takes time. This is especially true 
					in the context of long held beliefs and practices embedded in a socio-cultural 
					context. In teacher education, change in the teacher educator is seen as 
					fundamental to improved teacher practices in schools that lead to increased 
					learner performance and whole child development. Developing professional 
					learning communities is an important endeavor in creating change.

					How to Use 
					this Resource Book
				</h1>
				<p>
					This resource is designed to foster a transformation in the way teacher 
					educators understand their job and how they practice their profession. It 
					acknowledges that many teacher educators in African colleges of education 
					do not have ready access to articles, journals and other educational 
					research in their field. Also, professional development opportunities of 
					college educators have been and still are limited in scope and availability. 
					Opportunities for teachers' college faculty to participate in research and add 
					to local and global knowledge in the area of teacher education are almost 
					non-existent.
				</p>
				<div class="quoteBig">
					&quot;learning 
					is 'both

					and a

				</div>
				
				<p>
					<em>Professional Learning Communities in the Teachers' College</em> has eight 
					chapters, each one focused on a particular salient theme in teacher 
					education. These themes were identified through a review of the literature 
					on teacher education with an emphasis on pre-service teacher education 
					in Africa. It would be impossible to cover all areas of teacher education, 
					particularly all of the subject specialties. Consequently, though the scope of 
					the material is necessarily narrow, we hope that the structure of the material 
					and the accompanying resources will provide a base for deeper exploration 
					of topics in teacher education. The introduction explores professional 
					learning communities, how they might be established, and how this resource 
					may be used. Chapter 2 looks at some of the literature on pre-service teacher 
					education in Africa in order to provide a general description of the state of 
					teacher education in Africa as a way of placing the work teacher educators 
					do in a more global context. The remaining chapters each focus on a 
					specific pertinent theme, namely: (3) learning to teach, (4) learner-centered 
					education, (5) curriculum, (6) college teaching and learning, (7) expanding 
					college assessment and (8) reflective practice.

				</figure>
				<p>
					<em>Professional Learning Communities in the Teachers' College</em> is structured so that each chapter starts out by addressing a critical area 
					of teacher education and presenting a synopsis of research and theory in that area. This is followed by suggestions for seminars to 
					explore the theme in relation to the context in which you work. These seminars are only suggestions on how you might explore the 
					theme in depth and ways in which learning about the theme can influence your practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have a professional development program in place in your college, <em>Professional Learning Communities in the Teachers' 
					College</em> could be used as a resource. If you don't have a formal program you could start one with interested colleagues. Individual 
					college teacher educators may read and explore the manual and try out new approaches based on the readings. Groups of teacher 
					educators may use the material as part of their own professional development and colleges may set up a series of seminars tackling 
					some of the chapters in this book. <em>Professional Learning Communities in the Teachers' College</em> may also be used in education 
					programs for teacher educators, of which there are, regrettably, few in Africa.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many of the articles cited in the text are available on the accompanying CD-ROM for those who wish to go into more depth on any
					of the topics presented here. Websites are also listed for those 
					with access to the internet.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Professional Learning Communities in the Teachers' College</em> should not be seen as an authoritative and definitive treatise on 
					pre-service teacher education. Rather, you should use it as a 
					teacher education tool to help you update your knowledge and 
					expand your professional perspectives by critically examining 
					your own beliefs and understanding of teacher education, as 
					well as those of the institutions in which you work. It is expected 
					that the material will enable individuals and institutions 
					to improve professional competencies that would lead to 
					improved teaching and learning in schools. Whether used in 
					informal discussion or college-wide professional development 
					activities, the seminars are meant to stimulate thought, dialogue 
					and reflection and lead to improved practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The material is meant to help you do your job as a teacher 
					educator. The book takes a reform-minded perspective rather 
					than a traditional approach. This is because in many countries, 
					particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, educational reforms toward 
					learner-centered education in basic schools require teachers 
					skilled in the methods of holistic child-centered education. 
					In general, colleges in Africa have not been able to keep 
					pace with these reforms. This book does not  emphasize 
					a 'traditional' approach, which might be characterized as 
					teacher-centered where the predominant mode of instruction 
					is a 'transmission' mode, and social norms of strict hierarchy 
					are maintained between student teacher and lecturer (or 
					student and teacher) (Owuor, 2008), except to include it as 
					a perspective on education widely held by many educators 
					and analyze traditional approaches and their persistence in 
					education systems.

</h2>
				<h3>
					Introduction
				</h3>
				<p>
					This seminar will help you and your colleagues explore the 
					climate of professional development at your college. With 
					a group of colleagues you can form a professional learning 
					community. After reading through this chapter you can do the 
					activities and have a dialogue around the issues raised. Some of 
					the tasks require action. Reading, discussing and analyzing have 
					important roles in professional growth. Putting new ideas into 
					action shares that learning with others.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Specific Tasks
				</h3><figure class="float-r"><img src="../_img/slides/ch1/IMG_1981.jpg" alt="Female teacher with students sitting in class."  class="imgfix"></figure>
				<ol>
					<li> Prior to the seminar make a poster of Table 1.1. Add other 
						interactions that you think might be missing from the table. 
						Make a handout of the table for participants in the seminar 
						to use individually. </li>
					<li> Ask individuals to tick off the types of interactions listed 
						in Table 1.1 that you think characterize the way teacher 
						educators relate to each other at your college. Give plenty of 
						time for participants to tick off all those they think apply to 
						your college.</li>
					<li>To summarize the groups' responses, ask individuals to 
						make tick marks beside each interaction on the poster as a 
						way of tallying up all the participants' responses. </li>
					<li>Cluster the responses the group made into three categories: 
						interactions required by college administration, voluntary 
						actions leading to professional growth, interactions that 
						contribute little to professional development (make up more 
						alternative categories as appropriate).</li>
					<li>Examine the three clusters and the responses in each. What 
						does this say about your college? Discuss.</li>
					<li> What might be helpful in developing a more positive 
						professional development climate at the college? Discuss.</li>
					<li>In the article by Little, she describes how schools that are more 
						successful (learner performance and school atmosphere) 
						also tend to have stronger norms of collegiality among staff. 
						What are the norms of collegiality that she describes? Are 
						any of these norms prevailing at your college? Are the norms

					Maintaining a collegial atmosphere and ongoing dialogue and 
					reflection with your colleagues can be supported by providing 
					some structure to your professional learning communities. This

				<h3>
					Specific Tasks
				</h3>
				<ol>
					<li> With a group of colleagues interested in professional 
						development as teacher educators, form a group (or groups) 
						and set some parameters for your meetings. Some things 
						you might want to think about are:
						<ul>
							<li> How large your groups should be</li>
							<li> Where and when to meet, and how frequently meetings 
								should take place</li>
							<li> How to structure leadership of the groups
								d. Whether or not to record participation, outcomes, plans, 
								practices etc.</li>
							<li> Provision of materials in written or electronic form</li>
							<li> How to formalize your professional development seminars 
								in the context of your institution or Ministry of Education. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Prior to the first seminar read the suggested reading 
						listed above.</li>
					<li> In the first seminar it might be useful to discuss the need 
						for professional development as teacher educators. Some 
						guiding questions for a group discussion might be:
						<ul>
							<li> What is the level of professional training as teacher 
								educators that group members have had? Describe this 
								training as teacher educators. How effective was it?</li>
							<li>What have you learned on the job as a teacher educator? 
								How might on-the-job training be improved at your institution?</li>
							<li>What are your strengths as a teacher educator?</li>
							<li> What are your weak areas as a teacher educator? What 
								areas do you feel you need to improve? What support do 
								you need to improve in this area? How can the group of 
								teacher educators support that improvement?</li>
							<li> What are the barriers to professional development – 
								individually or institutionally? As a group discuss how 
								these barriers might be overcome.</li>
							<li> How will your own professional development benefit you? 
								How will it benefit student teachers? How will it benefit the 
								institution?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> What are the areas of expertise among the college staff? 
						Make an inventory of expertise among the teacher educators 
						and share it with the staff.</li>
					<li>What do teacher educators want to learn more about? What 
						skills do teacher educators want to improve or develop? Make a plan to address the professional development needs 
						at the college.</li>
					<li> What resources outside the college are available to your 
						group? What experts (teachers, administrators, Ministry 
						of Education Officials, etc.) are available to support your 
						professional learning communities?</li>

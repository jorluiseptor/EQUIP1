					Introduction: 
					A Resource For Teacher Educators
				</h1>
				<div class="quote">
					<em>"Practice in isolation...
					grooves errorful activity." </em> Huberman, 1995
				</div>
				<p class="fp">
					With the introduction of free primary education throughout Africa over the past 20 years, the 
					demand for more qualified teachers has grown tremendously (Nilsson, 2003). Mainstream 
					teacher education programs, typically consisting of 1-3 years of residence in teachers' 
					colleges and some form of practice teaching, are unable to meet this escalation in demand. 
					<img src="../_img/slides/103_0334.png" alt="Two men and a woman taking objects from the floor." width="200" height="267" class="imgfix float-l"> Given this, many countries have resorted to alternative models of teacher education to 
					supply the needed teachers in a short period of time (<em>Global Campaign for Education</em>, 
					2006; Lynd, 2005; Moon, 2007). A number of hybrid programs have also emerged to 
					deal with this increased demand for more teachers. With myriad approaches to teacher 
					education and recruitment in place simultaneously, the quality of most teacher education 
					programs has declined, resulting in calls for increased attention to quality (Carnoy, 2007).
				</p>
				<p>
					Isolation of teacher educators is not conducive to the development of teacher colleges 
					as high quality professional institutions. <em>Professional Learning Communities in the 
					Teachers' College</em>, responds to this need for collective reflection. In <em>Professional Learning 
					Communities</em> we take the perspective that teacher educators can transform their practice 
					through 1) updating their knowledge on salient educational issues for teacher education, 
					2) engaging in critical dialogue about those issues in relation to their personal beliefs and 
					the local context and 3) developing a reflective approach to their practice. The content of 
					all the chapters is aligned with these purposes. The main body of each chapter consists of 
					the main theoretical ideas underlying reforms in education. This is followed by proposed 
					seminars that prompt the participating teacher educators to carefully examine their own 
					system of teacher education and reflect on the possible ways of removing impediments to 
					reform. Given the central importance of the idea of professional learning communities, the 
					first chapter is devoted to surveying this idea. While the rest of the themes in the remaining 
					chapters will vary, the authors hope that seminars at the end of each chapter will be part of 
					a general effort to form professional learning communities.

					This <em>First Principles: Designing Effective Education Program That Promote Gender Equality </em> provides an overview of strategies for promoting gender equality. The principles, steps, and indicators are primarily meant to guide program designs, including the development of requests for and subsequent review of proposals, the implementation of program activities, and the development of performance management plans, evaluations, and research studies. The First Principles are intended to help USAID education officers specifically, as well as other stakeholders—including staff in donor agencies, government officials, and staff working for international and national nongovernmental organizations—who may be tasked with promoting, developing, and implementing gender-focused programs. Gender equality in education is multifaceted, and it does not mean working solely with girls. The guidance in this document is meant to be used and adapted for a variety of settings to help USAID officers, educators, and implementers overcome the numerous challenges in addressing gender issues, understand the importance of working on policy environments, and understand the multiple entry points for addressing gender inequalities. The last section provides references for those who would like to learn more about issues and methods for promoting gender equality.
The Digest version provides a brief overview of key considerations for promoting gender equility in education.
